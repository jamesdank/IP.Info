To use edit 14th line in ip.info.sh to the directory you have ip.info.php and make sure the path to php is right, this also creates a temp file "ip.info.txt" in the users directory then deletes it after the request to http://ip-api.com/json/ if you're getting info about an IP address other than your own, if you look up your info it doesn't create a file, it's created to pass info from bash to php.
